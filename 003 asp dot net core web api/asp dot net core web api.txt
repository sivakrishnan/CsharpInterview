Beginner ASP.NET Core Web API Interview Questions

###1) What is ASP.NET Core?

###2) What is a Web API?

###3) What is the difference between ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core Web API?

###4) What is REST?

	REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
	It is an architectural style (not a protocol) for designing distributed systems — especially web services — based on these principles:

	Stateless communication
	Resources identified by URIs
	Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
	Use of standard HTTP status codes
	Transfer representations (usually JSON or XML) of resources
	Client-server separation

###5) What are HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)?

###6) What is routing in ASP.NET Core?

###7) How do you return JSON from a Web API?

	In ASP.NET Core Web API, JSON is returned automatically. 
	If you return a POCO object or ActionResult<T>, the framework serializes it to JSON using System.Text.Json. 
	You can also explicitly return JSON using Ok(object) or JsonResult. The response is by default application/json unless content negotiation decides otherwise."
	
	IActionResult 		  ----> return Ok(Product) 			---->return the json
	ActionResult<Product> ----> return Product 				---->return the json (behind the code, it will automatically wrapped with Ok(product)
	IActionResult 		  -----> return JsonResult(Product) ---->explicitly return the json

###8) What is a controller in ASP.NET Core Web API?

###9) Explain the role of Startup.cs.

	The Startup.cs file configures the services and the request pipeline in ASP.NET Core. 
	The ConfigureServices method is used to "register services with the dependency injection container", such as EF Core, Identity, logging, or custom repositories. 
	The Configure method defines how the app handles "HTTP requests by setting up middleware" like routing, authentication, authorization, exception handling, etc. 
	In .NET 6+, the Startup class is optional because these configurations can be done directly in Program.cs, but the underlying concepts remain the same.

###10) What is middleware?

	Middleware in ASP.NET Core is a software component that sits in the HTTP request pipeline. Each middleware can inspect, modify, or short-circuit a request and/or response. 
	They execute in order, so the sequence matters a lot. ASP.NET Core provides built-in middleware like routing, authentication, authorization, and exception handling, 
	and we can also create custom middleware for cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, or rate limiting.

###11) How do you test an ASP.NET Core Web API using tools like Postman?

###12) How do you enable CORS in an ASP.NET Core Web API?

	CORS in ASP.NET Core is enabled using the AddCors service and the UseCors middleware. 
	We define a CORS policy in Program.cs or Startup.cs, specifying allowed origins, headers, and methods. 
	Then we apply that policy globally with app.UseCors("PolicyName") or per controller/action using the [EnableCors] attribute. 
	By default, ASP.NET Core blocks cross-origin requests, so enabling CORS is necessary when the frontend and backend are hosted on different domains.
	
	1. Register CORS in Program.cs
	
	// Add CORS services
	
	builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
	{
		options.AddPolicy("AllowSpecificOrigin",
			policy =>
			{
				policy.WithOrigins("https://app.example.com") // allowed origin
					  .AllowAnyHeader()
					  .AllowAnyMethod();
			});
	});
	
	
	2. Enable CORS in the middleware pipeline
	
	var app = builder.Build();

	// Use CORS globally
	app.UseCors("AllowSpecificOrigin");

	app.UseAuthorization();
	app.MapControllers();
	app.Run();
	
	3. Enable CORS per controller or action (optional)

	Instead of global, you can apply per-controller:

	[ApiController]
	[Route("api/[controller]")]
	[EnableCors("AllowSpecificOrigin")]  // apply policy here
	public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
	{
		[HttpGet]
		public IActionResult GetProducts()
		{
			return Ok(new[] { "Laptop", "Phone", "Tablet" });
		}
	}

###13) What is dependency injection in ASP.NET Core?

###14) Explain the appsettings.json file.

###15) How do you handle exceptions in an ASP.NET Core Web API?

✅ Intermediate ASP.NET Core Web API Interview Questions


###1) What is model binding?

	[FromRoute] → bind from route
	[FromQuery] → bind from query string
	[FromBody] → bind from request body  --------------> Content Type=application/json
	[FromForm] → bind from form data --------------> Content Type= multipart/form-data or application/x-www-form-urlencoded

	[FromHeader] → bind from headers

	X-Correlation-Id: 12345
	public IActionResult GetOrders([FromHeader(Name = "X-Correlation-Id")] string correlationId)

###2) What is model validation?

###3) How do you implement attribute routing?

###4) What is the difference between IActionResult and ActionResult<T>?

	IActionResult is a flexible interface that lets you return any type of HTTP response, 
	while ActionResult<T> combines type safety with flexibility. With ActionResult<T> you can return either a strongly typed object (which automatically becomes a 200 OK response) 
	or other HTTP responses like NotFound() or BadRequest(). It also improves Swagger/OpenAPI documentation by clearly showing the response type.


	[HttpGet("{id}")]
	public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
	{
		var product = _repository.GetById(id);

		if (product == null)
			return NotFound();

		return Ok(product);
	}
	
	[HttpGet("{id}")]
	public ActionResult<Product> GetProduct(int id)
	{
		var product = _repository.GetById(id);

		if (product == null)
			return NotFound();

		return product; // automatically wrapped in Ok(product)
	}

###5) How do you use filters in ASP.NET Core (action filters, exception filters)?

###6) What is the purpose of ApiController attribute?

###7) What is Swagger (OpenAPI), and how do you integrate it?

###8) How do you secure a Web API using JWT (JSON Web Token)?

###9) What is middleware pipeline ordering and why does it matter?

###10) Explain environment-based configuration in ASP.NET Core.

###11) What is asynchronous programming and why is it important in Web APIs?

###12) What is content negotiation?

	Content negotiation is the process where the server and the client agree on the best format for the response data.
	in short server and client agree on data format dynamically.
	
	If a client sends:
	Accept: application/json
	the server responds with JSON.
	example: 
	
		{
		  "id": 1,
		  "name": "Phone"
		}
	
	If a client sends:
	Accept: application/xml
	the server responds with XML
	example: 
		<Product>
		  <Id>1</Id>
		  <Name>Phone</Name>
		</Product>
	
	in program.cs
	
	builder.Services.AddControllers().AddXmlSerializerFormatters();

###13) How do you handle file uploads in Web API?

###14) How do you inject a custom service into your controller?

###15) Explain versioning of Web APIs.

	1) URI versioning (most common)
		/api/v1/products
		/api/v2/products
		
	2) Query string versioning		
		/api/products?api-version=1.0
		
	3) Header versioning
		api-version: 1.0
	
	4) Media type versioning 
		Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v1+json
		
	Microsoft provides a great NuGet package:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning
	
	in program.cs file
	
		builder.Services.AddApiVersioning(options =>
		{
			options.DefaultApiVersion = new ApiVersion(1, 0);
			options.AssumeDefaultVersionWhenUnspecified = true;
			options.ReportApiVersions = true;
		});
