Linear Algebra Roadmap for AI / ML Beginners
1️) Scalars, Vectors, Matrices 🔥 - All data, weights, images, embeddings = vectors & matrices


Scalar vs Vector vs Matrix
Row vector vs Column vector
Matrix dimensions (shape)
Matrix notation


2️) Vector Operations 🔥 - Dot product = similarity, predictions, neuron output

Vector addition
Scalar multiplication
Dot product ⭐⭐⭐
Vector length (magnitude)
Unit vectors


3️) Matrix Operations 🔥🔥 - Neural networks are just matrix multiplications

Matrix addition
Scalar × matrix
Matrix × vector
Matrix × matrix ⭐⭐⭐
Matrix transpose

4️) Systems of Linear Equations 🔥 - Regression = solving linear equations

Linear equations
Matrix form: Ax = b
Solution intuition (no heavy proofs)

5️) Linear Transformations 🔥 - Neural layers transform input data

What a transformation is
Rotation, scaling, translation
How matrices represent transformations


6️) dentity, Inverse & Rank 🔥 - Optimization & stability in ML models

Identity matrix
Inverse of a matrix (intuition only)
Rank of a matrix


7️) Determinant ⚪ - Helps understand invertibility

What determinant means
Zero determinant = no inverse


8️) Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors 🔥🔥🔥

What eigenvectors mean (direction unchanged)
Eigenvalues intuition
Relation to matrix transformation
PCA (dimensionality reduction)
Covariance matrices
Stability in deep learning

9️) Orthogonality & Projections 🔥 - Similarity search, Embeddings (NLP, recommender systems)

Orthogonal vectors
Projection of vector onto another
Cosine similarity

10) Norms & Distance Measures 🔥 - Loss functions, Regularization

L1 norm
L2 norm
Euclidean distance
 
 
1️1) Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) ⚪→🔥  - Dimensionality reduction, Image compression, Recommendation systems

Concept (not math proof)
What SVD decomposes into


1️2) Matrix Calculus (Preview Only) 🔥 - Training ML models = gradient descent


Gradient intuition
Partial derivatives (idea)
