What is AWS ALB?

---> ALB is a super advanced, next generation Load Balancer in AWS
---> Support for Path-based Routing (/app1, /app2, /usermgmt)
---> Support for Host-based Routing (apps.kubeoncloud.com, users.kubeoncloud.com)
---> Support for routing based on fields in the request (http headers, http methods, Query parameters and source IP address)
---> Support for redirecting requests from one URL to another
---> Support for returning a custom http response.
---> Support for registering Lambda functions as targets

---> Support for the Load balancer to authenticate users of your applications through their corporate or social identities before routing requests
---> Support for containerized applications (AWS ECS)
---> Support for monitoring the health of each service independently, as health checks are defined at the target group level.
---> Support for registering targets by IP address, including targets outside the VPC for the load balancer.

ALB Ingress Controller - ALBIC

---> ALBIC triggers the creation of an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and the necessary supporting AWS resources whenever an Ingress resources is created on the cluster with the "kubernetes.io/ingress.class:alb" annotation.
---> ALB Ingress Controller supports two traffic modes
		---> Instance
		---> IP
		
--->  Instance Mode

	---> Register worker nodes within your cluster as targets for the ALB.
	---> Traffic reaching the ALB is routed to Node port for your service and then proxied to your pods
	---> This is the default traffic mode.
	---> You can also explicitly specify it with the "alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type:instance" annotation
	
---> IP Mode

	---> Registers pods as targets for the ALB.
	---> Traffic reaching the ALB is directly routed to pods for your service.
	---> You must specify the "alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type:ip" annotation to use this traffic mode.
