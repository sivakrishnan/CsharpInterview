How can user Access AWS?

To Access AWS, you have three options:

	AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)
	AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) : protected by access keys
	AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) : protected by access keys
	
Acess Keys are generated through the AWS Console
users can manage their own access keys
Access keys are secret, just like a password. Dont share them

Access key ID ~= username
Secret Access Key ~= password 


AWS Command Line Interface (CLI):

	A tool that enables you to interact with AWS Services using commands in your command line shell
	Direct Access to the public APIs of AWS Services
	You can develop scripts to manage your resources
	Alternative to using AWS Management Console

AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) :

	Language-specific APIs (set of libraries)
	Enables you to access and manage AWS Services programmatically
	Embadded within your application
	Supports SDK (javascript, Python, PHP, .Net, Ruby, Java, GO, Node.js, C++)
	Mobile SDK (Android, iOS..)
	IoT SDk
