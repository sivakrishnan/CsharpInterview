EC2--> Elastic Compute Cloud (Infrastructure as a Service)

It mainly consists in the capability of:

	Renting Virtual Machines (EC2)
	Storing data in virtual drives (EBS)
	Distributing Load across machines (ELB)
	Scaling the services using an Auto-Scaling Group (ASG)

EC2 Sizing & Configuration Options

	Operating Systems: Linux, Windows or Mac
	How much Compute Power and Core (CPU)
	How much Random Access Memory (RAM)
	How much Storage Space:
		Network Attached:(EBS, EFS)
		hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
	Network Card: speed of the card, public IP Address
	Firewall rules: security groups
	Bootstrap scripts(configure at first launch): EC2 User data
		It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User Data Script
		bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
		That scripts is only run once at the instance first starts
		EC2 User Data, is used to automate boots tasks such as:
		
			Installing updates
			Installing software
			Downloading common files from the internet
	
	m5.2xlarge
	
	m-> Instance Class
	5-> generation(AWS improves them over time)
	2xlarge ->size within the instance class

	EC2 Instances Types
	
		General Purpose
		Compute Optimized
		Memory Optimized
		Accelarated Computing
		Storage Optimized
		HPC Optimized (High Performance Computing)
		Instance Feature
		Messuring Instance Performance
		
@@@ Video 35: (7 mins): Security Groups & Classic Ports Overview

	Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
	They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances
	Security Groups only contain "Allow" rules
	Security Groups rules can reference by IP or by security group


	Security groups are acting as a "Firewall" on EC2 instances
	They regulates:
	
		Access to the ports
		Authorized IP address (IPv4 and IPv6
		Control of inbound network (by default all the inbound traffic are blocked
		Control of outbound network (by default all the outbound traffic are authorized)
		
	Classic Ports to know
	
		22---> SSH (Secure Shell) - log into linux instance
		21---> FTP (File Transfer Protocol) uploads files into a file share
		22---> SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) upload files using SSH
		80---> HTTP - access unsecured websites
		443---> HTTPS - access secured websites
		3389---> RDP - (Remote Desktop Protocol) log into windows instance

@@@ Video 37: (3 mins): SSH Overview

SSH Allows to control a virtual machine, all using the command line

they way to connect with EC2 Instances

Mac ---> SSH, EC2 Instance Connect
Linux ---> SSH, EC2 Instance Connect
Windows<10 ---> Putty, EC2 Instance Connect
Windows>=10 ---> SSH, Putty, EC2 Instance Connect

Open Command just type ----> ssh

output:

usage: ssh [-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-B bind_interface] [-b bind_address]
           [-c cipher_spec] [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file]
           [-e escape_char] [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11] [-i identity_file]
           [-J destination] [-L address] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec]
           [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-P tag] [-p port] [-Q query_option]
           [-R address] [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port] [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]]
           destination [command [argument ...]]
		   
so we can confirm that SSH is available

go to the directory which have .pem file.

type the following command in windows command

---> cd "give the directory have .pem file"
---> C:\Users\CIPL1543\Downloads> dir   to check weather the .pem file is available
---> C:\Users\CIPL1543\Downloads>ssh -i .\MyFirstKeyPair.pem ec2-user@43.204.236.233

while u login with EC2 instance using SSH, dont use your user securitykey and Secret Access Key

instead assign a "Role" to EC2 instance

EC2 instance Purchasing Options

	1) On-Demand Instances
	2) Reserved
	3) Savings Plan
	4) Spot Instances
	5) Dedicated Hosts  ---> book an entire physical server
